# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a diabetes prediction model built using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model is designed to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various medical features.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes. The prediction is based on features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and other health-related metrics. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used for this purpose due to its effectiveness in classification tasks.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the [PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), which is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. The dataset consists of 768 instances, with 8 features:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

The target variable is a binary outcome indicating whether the patient has diabetes (`1`) or not (`0`).
